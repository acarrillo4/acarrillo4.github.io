      <p>My Name is Amy Carrillo.  I currently work as a Service Desk Analyst I for Cars.com.  Being the only female in my team at work, has motivated me and pushed me towards advancing my skills in Technology.</p>
      <p>I graduated with a Mathematics degree in 2015, and have since grown an interest for learning Computer Programming. I am currently a coding bootcamp student at Northwestern University, and will graduate in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Through this program, I've gotten the opportunity to learn many of the technologies/tools used in Full Stack Development.</p>
      <p>The greatest thing about this program, is being able to take part in this journey, alongside other motivated/intellectual rockstars!</p>
      <p>Feel free to explore My Portfolio to preview some of my AWESOME work :)</p>
